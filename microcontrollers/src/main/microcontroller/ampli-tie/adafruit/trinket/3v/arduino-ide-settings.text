Arduino IDE Setting for Ampli-tie on Adafruit 3V Trinket

        OS: Mac OS X
      Port: /dev/cu.SerialPort-1
Programmer: USBTinyISP
     Board: Adafruit Trinket 8MHz

	    Note selecting the Adafruit Trinket 16MHz did not work, with the strand test.


This looks like it will not work because I could not find an Ardunino Uno Analog href equivalent 
on the Trinket.  I am gonna try the 3V trinket next.
