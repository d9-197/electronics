As a weather data logger,
I need to recieve sensor values from the microcontroller,
so that I can post them to the AdafruitIO Internet of Things platform.

Acceptance Criteria

The weather station relay application reads sensor values over a serial connection and 
the posts to the IoT platform are spaced by a user-specified time interval and
the feed endpoints are configured via a user-specified properties file and
the sensor values are mapped to feeds via a user-specified properties file.
